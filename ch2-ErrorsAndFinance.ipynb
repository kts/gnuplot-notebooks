    "Chapter 2: Errors and Finance\n",
    "=============================\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter will show you how to plot values with errors or ranges. The\n",
    "examples in this chapter all use a data file rather than mathematical\n",
    "functions. You should download the file, called “statdata,” which should\n",
    "be available in the sample place where you downloaded this book.\n",
    "Alternatively, you may of course use your own data, if you have some\n",
    "that you’d like to work with. This might be more interesting for you;\n",
    "however, the examples here assume that the data columns are in a\n",
    "particular order. We’ll be clear about what that order is, so you can\n",
    "either rearrange the format of your files or make small alterations to\n",
    "the example scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the graphs in this chapter will appear to be similar to the\n",
    "basic 2D graphs of the previous chapter, with some extra marks added to\n",
    "the data points. These marks convey additional numbers associated with\n",
    "each value of the independent variable (usually, the x-axis). There can\n",
    "be as many as four additional numbers associated with each point. This\n",
    "would, in a sense, be a six-dimensional graph. In most of our examples,\n",
    "these additional numbers represent the estimated error in a measurement,\n",
    "or a possible range of values; this plot style is commonly seen in\n",
    "scientific publications. We include financial plots in this chapter as\n",
    "well, because they use similar concepts to display a range of values,\n",
    "and sometimes use the same graphical conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Data File\n",
    "-------------\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll use the same file of data for all the examples in this chapter.\n",
    "This file, called “statdata,” contains 10 lines. The data represent the\n",
    "function $y = x$, with “random” errors added to both the $x$ and $y$\n",
    "values. Errors in the positive and negative direction are included\n",
    "separately. Each line of the file therefore contains six numbers,\n",
    "representing the following values:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x\\qquad y\\qquad x^-\\qquad x^+\\qquad y^-\\qquad y^+$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $y^+$ means the value of $y$ plus the estimated error in the\n",
    "positive direction, $y^-$ means the value of $y$ with the estimated\n",
    "error in the negative direction subtracted, etc. (so the positive error\n",
    "itself would be $y^+ - y$, for example). The “errors” are all generated\n",
    "randomly; they are not simply departures from the “theoretical” $y = x$\n",
    "line. It is more usual in experimental scenarios to have a simple Δy\n",
    "and/or Δx, representing the estimated total error in the measurements,\n",
    "but sometimes we have separate error estimates on the positive and\n",
    "negative side; and since gnuplot can handle these, we include the\n",
    "general case in our data file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Column Selection\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the examples in this chapter use only a few of the six columns\n",
    "of data in the `statdata` file. Also, we will sometimes need to perform\n",
    "some simple arithmetic on the data before handing it off to gnuplot for\n",
    "plotting. All of this can be done simply and easily with the gnuplot\n",
    "`using` keyword. This can be abbreviated to `u`. The `using` command is\n",
    "very important, so we’ll introduce it with several examples. The first\n",
    "example shows how to select columns from a data file. We use the `u`\n",
    "abbreviation for `using`; the phrase `u 1:3` tells gnuplot to use the\n",
    "first and third columns, etc. So this script makes three normal, 2D\n",
    "plots, plotting the second, third, and fourth column against the first.\n",
    "The default plot style when plotting from a data file is “points”,\n",
    "rather than “lines,” which is the default when plotting functions. The\n",
    "script uses the pointtypes (`pt`) 9 and 8 to select triangles for\n",
    "columns 3 and 4: this is meant to suggest a range of $y$ values. The\n",
    "script shows one way to plot a set of values and their ranges using the\n",
    "normal plotting commands that we’ve already learned; many other\n",
    "approaches are possible, limited only by your creativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ve illustrated a useful shorthand notation in the script. The empty\n",
    "string (`\"\"`) means the previously mentioned data file: in this case, we\n",
    "are telling gnuplot to plot from `statdata` three times (it starts from\n",
    "the beginning of the file for each plot)."

    "expands the axis ranges in the order *left, right, bottom, top*. If you\n",
    "use this, you usually want to use it with the `set auto fix` command, as\n",
