    "\n",
    "The small programs, or scripts, that we have seen in all the examples up\n",
    "to now have been simply lists of commands that gnuplot executes one at a\n",
    "time, ending, if all goes well, with the graph that you want. You have\n",
    "been talking to gnuplot using its internal scripting language. But this\n",
    "language can do more: in fact, it contains many of the features of a\n",
    "real programming language. In this chapter we’ll learn how to use these\n",
    "programming features to automate some graphing tasks, including the\n",
    "creation of a sequence of images that can be turned into an animation.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an example script creates an animation, we’ll display the first\n",
    "frame of the animation, in the place where we normally display the\n",
    "example graph, overlayed with an icon resembling a movie camera. The\n",
    "movie file is embedded in the book’s PDF file as an attachment; not all\n",
    "PDF readers know how to deal with attachments, but most fairly recent\n",
    "ones do. In most PDF document readers, you merely need to click on the\n",
    "picture to open the movie in your default video application; in some,\n",
    "including many PDF readers built-in to web browsers, you need to\n",
    "double-click. The situation is the same as for the “open script” boxes\n",
    "beneath the code samples. If your reader doesn’t seem to be responding\n",
    "to your clicks on the image, you can follow the link beneath it to the\n",
    "movie file on the publisher’s website (if your PDF reader can’t follow\n",

    "Gnuplot’s syntax includes a *ternary operator*, which works in gnuplot\n",
    "similar to the way it works in C and some other programming languages.\n",
    "The structure is `C ?  A : B`, where `C` is a condition that evaluates\n",

    "`A` is ignored. In other words, it is a concise way to write “if C then\n",
    "A; else B”. The ternary operator is especially useful in defining\n",
    "functions piecewise over subintervals of the domain, as in the example\n",
    "below. In the script, `NaN` is used for a “missing value”: it stands for\n",
    "*not a number*, and is one way to make a value undefined in gnuplot. The\n",
    "plot can represent a harmonic oscillator with a frictional damping that\n",
    "is turned on at t = 0. (The observant may notice that the function is\n",
    "defined twice at x = 0. This is to avoid the small inter-sample gap that\n",
