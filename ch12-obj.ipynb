    "Chapter 12: Objects and Arrows\n",
    "==============================\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of our work with gnuplot up to now has involved commands that cause\n",
    "the program to draw lines, curves, surfaces, or sets of objects such as\n",
    "markers based on values in a table of data or generated from functions.\n",
    "Along with this, gnuplot will plot axes, labels, and other apparatuses\n",
    "to help in the interpretation of the visualization. In this chapter we\n",
    "learn how to plot **objects**, which are rectangles, ellipses, circles,\n",
    "or polygons, with a specifiable size, shape, color, pattern, etc., at\n",
    "specific locations. The objects are added to the graph when it is\n",
    "created with the `plot` or `splot` command; when working interactively,\n",
    "each new plotting command will add the defined list of objects until\n",
    "they are unset. Objects can be used to add information or decorations to\n",
    "a plot, or be used themselves to convey the plot’s main information\n",
    "content, as an alternative to the conventional lines, surfaces, etc.\n",
    "Each object can (optionally) be assigned an integer *tag*, so that its\n",
    "properties can be selectively changed or so that it can be unset\n",
    "(removed from the graph)\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ve already had a preview of one common use of objects: defining a\n",
    "filled rectangle that sits behind the plot to [create a background\n",
    "color](#cubehelix-stripes).\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter will also cover gnuplot’s *arrows*. Although arrows are\n",
    "most often used in concert with text labels, they fit better in this\n",

    "example script. It sets the default fill color to a blue-green color\n",
    "with transparency (an alpha of 0x55), with no border. The second and\n",
    "third lines create two partially overlapping rectangle objects. The\n",
    "`from` and `to` clauses give the locations of the lower-left and\n",
    "upper-right corners, in the default axis coordinate system. Object 3 is\n",
    "another rectangle, but here the default fill style is overridden with a\n",
    "purple color. Object 4 uses the `at` specification, which sets the\n",
    "location of the *center* of the rectangle, and uses graph coordinates to\n",
    "conveniently size the rectangle to be slightly larger than the graph. A\n",
    "fill pattern (`fs`) is set (the `test` command will show you the\n",
    "patterns supported by your terminal), and the `behind` clause places the\n",
    "rectangle behind everything, so that it can serve as a background. The\n",

    "space, or, more precisely, sets of closed 2D polygons positioned in 3D.\n",
    "There are two different ways to construct the plots, that produce\n",
    "different effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first way, a list of vertex positions, defining a set of\n",
    "polygons, is plotted with a new command,\n",
    "`splot <$vertices> with polygons`. This colors all the polygons\n",
    "identically, so either transparency or [ambient lighting](#lighting) is\n",
    "required to create a legible shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second way is more powerful, because it allows different colors and\n",
    "opacities to be applied to each polygon. This method uses gnuplot’s new\n",
    "polygon object type. Instead of a block of coordinates, required when\n",
    "using the first method, we define a list of objects, as in the use of\n",
    "polygons described in previous sections. This is the method illustrated\n",

    "\n",
    "The six polygon objects defined in this script are arranged to form a\n",
    "box with the top partially open. The coloring of 3D polygons is done\n",
