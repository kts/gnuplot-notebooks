    "things that connect the curves, colors, and surfaces in your plots to\n",

    "numerical day, `%H` to stand for the numerical hour using a 24-hour\n",
    "clock, and so on. For a summary of all the formats that gnuplot\n",
    "understands, type `help timefmt` at the interactive prompt. For our\n",
    "example data, the format should be `%d/%m/%y %H:%M`. This tells gnuplot\n",
    "about the single space between the date and time, the colon between the\n",
    "hours and minutes, etc. The format must be complete and exact. Only then\n",
