    "Chapter 3: Histograms and Bar Charts\n",
    "====================================\n",
    "\n",
    "The title of this chapter refers to two different things that are\n",
    "sometimes confused.\n",
    "\n",
    "A bar chart is a type of 2D plot uses the heights of a series of\n",
    "vertical (or, sometimes, horizontal) bars, drawn with gaps between them,\n",
    "to indicate the quantities of a small or moderate number of different\n",
    "things, so they can be compared visually. Although it is a type of 2D\n",
    "plot, we discuss it in this chapter rather than in Chapter 1, because it\n",
    "is a special case, and because of the similarity between bar charts and\n",
    "histograms. You are about to see many examples of bar charts, which\n",
    "should make the description above clear; they are also ubiquitous in\n",
    "journalism and advertising.\n",
    "\n",
    "A histogram is a [little\n",
    "different](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/histograms.html). This\n",
    "visualization shows how a continuous variable is distributed among\n",
    "different ranges of values. The bars in a histogram are plotted abutting\n",
    "each other. When used to visualize a distribution, their width, as well\n",
    "as their height, is significant: each bar’s area is proportional to the\n",
    "number of data points that it represents.\n",
    "\n",
    "For most of the examples in this chapter we use a datafile called\n",
    "“energySources”. This is a table of a handful of countries and the\n",
    "percentage of energy production for each country from several sources.\n",
    "The data is real, and comes from the [CIA World\n",
    "Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/rankorderguide.html).\n",
    "If you take a look at this datafile, you can see how comments can be\n",
    "added, using the “\\#” symbol, and how textual labels can be included\n",
    "with the data. You should have downloaded the file from the same place\n",
    "where you downloaded this text.\n",
    "\n",
    "`steps` and `fsteps`\n",
    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first example in this chapter is not actually about histograms, nor\n",
    "about bar charts, but rather about gnuplot’s step styles; we’re\n",
    "including it here because of some similarity to histogram plots,\n",
    "especially the `histeps` plot in the next example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line in the script shows another way to set a style option, in\n",
    "this case for the `linewidth`. Setting a `termoption` will set a default\n",
    "`lw`, so we won’t need to append the phrase to each plot command.\n",
    "\n",
    "We plot the `parabola.dat` file, a table of a simple parabola; you can\n",
    "download it from the usual place. The new plot styles are highlighted,\n",
    "and the graph shows the difference between the `steps` and `fsteps`\n",
    "styles; the normal `linespoints` plot is included for reference. As you\n",
    "can see, both styles plot the data with horizontal and vertical line\n",
    "segments; the difference is whether you go down first and then to the\n",
    "right, or right first and then down."
