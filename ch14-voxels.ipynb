    "Chapter 14: Voxels\n",
    "==================\n",
    "\n",
    "Voxel plots\n",
    "-----------\n",
    "\n",
    "A voxel is the 3D analogue of the pixel. This type of visualization,\n",
    "completely new in gnuplot v. 5.4, allows the rendering of data in 3D\n",
    "space. Voxel data are familiar in medical imaging, where they are used\n",
    "to display the results of MRIs or CAT scans, and in engineering or\n",
    "physics, where they are helpful in understanding such things as the 3D\n",
    "flow pattern around a propeller. Up to now, “3D” plotting in gnuplot was\n",
    "confined to rendering surfaces in various ways, drawing curves, or\n",
    "placing points within the 3D space: in other words, 2D, 1D, or 0D\n",
    "objects embedded in a volume region. All these types of plots are\n",
    "covered in previous chapters. Voxel plotting, in contrast, is true 3D\n",
    "visualization of 3D information; you can think of it as the 3D version\n",
    "of a 2D heatmap. What this means will become clear with the examples in\n",
    "this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to understand this is that a surface plot is a visualization\n",
    "of a function of two variables: $z = f(x, y)$. With voxel plotting, we\n",
    "can now visualize functions of three variables: $f(x, y, z)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "All voxel plotting begins with the establishment of a voxel grid, or\n",
    "`vgrid`. This is simply a regular cubic array of places in which to\n",
    "store values. It is perhaps better to think of the volume as divided\n",
    "into an array of subvolumes, each of which is filled with its local\n",
    "value, than as divided into an array of points. The command to set up a\n",
    "100 × 100 × 100 grid, and give it the name `$v`, is\n",
    "`set vgrid $v size 100` (the names of voxel grids must start with a\n",
    "dollar sign). A new voxel grid is initialized with 0 at every point.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to reinitialize the vgrid after working with it, you must do\n",
    "`unset vgrid $v`, using whatever name you have assigned it, and then\n",
    "enter `set vgrid` again; simply reentering `set vgrid` with the same\n",
    "dimensions will not zero the voxel values. Another option is `vclear`,\n",
    "which zeroes the active grid, or a different one with an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we do any plotting with this grid, we want, as usual, to set the\n",
    "ranges on the axes; but now, there are two sets of ranges: the usual\n",
    "`xrange`, etc., for the box that holds the plot, and new ones called\n",
    "`vxrange`, etc, for the coordinate extents of the voxel grid. The voxel\n",
    "grid has an existence independent of the grids used to plot it, or the\n",
    "coordinate system in which it is placed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have our voxel grid, we need to fill it with values in order\n",
    "to have something to plot. It will be instructive to use one example,\n",
    "with a simple physical interpretation, and show how to visualize it in\n",
    "several ways. Our example for the rest of this chapter will be the\n",
    "potential field (“voltage”) surrounding two equal and opposite charges:\n",
    "an electric dipole. This is a model, for example, of the [potential\n",
    "field around a water\n",
    "molecule](http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/water_molecule.html), if you are\n",
    "not too close to the molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the capabilities recently added to gnuplot is the ability to\n",
    "store blocks of data in named variables. We’ll use this to define a\n",
    "little data block that holds the locations of the two charges and their\n",
    "charge values. If we use a range of `[0 : 1]`, the command to create the\n",
    "data block can be\n",
    "\n",
    "    $charges << EOD\n",
    "    0 0 0.75 1\n",
    "    0 0 0.25 -1\n",
    "    EOD\n",
    "\n",
    "In `$charges`, the first three columns are x, y, and z, so the charges\n",
    "are on the z-axis. The fourth column is for the charge values.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this, we can use `$charges` in any command where we need to refer\n",
    "to this data. Just by changing this command, you can alter all the\n",
    "examples in this chapter to plot the potential field surrounding any\n",
    "configuration of charges that you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to do something with these coordinates, and that brings us\n",
    "to our second new command, `vfill`. This command is a little confusing\n",
    "to wrap your head around because it operates on two grids at once. It\n",
    "takes a grid of coordinates, which need not be the same size as the\n",
    "voxel grid, and, for each point therein, finds all the points in the\n",
    "voxel grid that lie within a given radius of the point. Each of these\n",
    "voxel locations gets a specified value added to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proceeding with our example may make this more concrete. We’re going to\n",
    "use the `vfill` command to add the contribution to the potential field\n",
    "from each charge to the voxel grid. For this purpose, it will be\n",
    "convenient to have a function that calculates that potential at a given\n",
    "distance from the charge:\n",
    "\n",
    "    pot(r) = r > 0 ? 1/r : 10^6                                                                              \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have used gnuplot’s ternary notation, which borrows from c and\n",
    "other languages. The function `pot` will return the usual potential for\n",
    "positive distances, but gives us an arbitrary large number if we are\n",
    "right on top of the charge, where the potential would be infinite.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use this in a `vfill` command to populate the voxel grid this\n",
    "way:\n",
    "\n",
    "    vfill $charges using 1:2:3:(2):($4*pot(VoxelDistance))\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will consider each charge in turn. For each charge, it will\n",
    "determine which voxels are within a radius of 2 of the charge, and add\n",
    "to the value there the value of the potential. Gnuplot supplies the\n",
    "convenience function `VoxelDistance`, that returns the distance from\n",
    "each point in the voxel grid to the grid point under consideration. For\n",
    "the radius, we just wanted to include every point in the grid, so we\n",
    "used a value larger than the largest distance within the cube\n",
    "($\\sqrt{3}$); anything larger would have the same effect. This command,\n",
    "and all the plotting commands below that will refer to voxel values, use\n",
    "the *currently active voxel grid*, which is the one most recently\n",
    "defined. As you can see, we’re not bothering with physical constants or\n",
    "units; we are only interested in the shape of the potential field. If we\n",
    "want to, we can convert to physical units at any time with a simple\n",
    "scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, the command in general takes the form\n",
    "\n",
    "    vfill XYX-coordinates using x:y:z:(radius):(value)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have populated the voxel grid with values, we would\n",
    "naturally like to look at them, to see the configuration of the\n",
    "potential field. Gnuplot gives us four distinct ways to do this, and\n",
    "they are all variations of the familiar `splot` command for plotting\n",
    "surfaces. The examples in the rest of this chapter will show us how to\n",
    "use all of these new plot commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a new function, `voxel(x, y, z)` which returns the value stored\n",
    "in the active voxel grid at the specified 3D location. \\\\index{voxel\n",
    "function Note that the current release (version 5.4 patchlevel rc2) will\n",
    "crash with a segfault if you ask for `voxel(x, y, z)` after initalizing\n",
    "the voxel grid but before adding any values with `vfill`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotting Points in 3D\n",
    "---------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The `splot` command can now plot a collection of points in 3D with their\n",
    "colors, sizes, and types taken from any data source, as before in 2D;\n",
    "the voxel grid is simply an additional source of data. So we can begin\n",
    "by making a picture showing the location of our charges, without\n",
    "reference to the voxel grid at all. These examples, as in every chapter,\n",
    "are all self-contained: you can run these scripts as-is in gnuplot (as\n",
    "long as you are using v. 5.4) and they will produce the plot shown. That\n",
    "is the reason for the repeated setup in many of the examples."

    "-------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to have more options when making the type of volume plot that\n",
    "we saw in the last few examples, we will have to make a coordinate grid\n",
    "and `splot` it, using the voxel grid as a data source. This will allow\n",
    "us to include a `using` clause, which means that we’ll be able to vary\n",
    "the opacity, color, point size, and point type with the voxel data. The\n",
    "next few examples will explore some of the possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although our examples are self-contained, the ones that follow will\n",
    "require a data file consisting of a grid of coordinates. In 1D and 2D\n",

    "representations will work, but the bit shift operator, the first one, is\n",
    "the most concise way to convert values from 0 to 255 into numbers for\n",

    "1/2 = 0 in gnuplot. Also, since gnuplot doesn’t come with a min nor a\n",
    "max function, we’ll have to make our own.)\n",
